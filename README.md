## ‚ö†Ô∏è Possible problems

There may be problems on systems where the file system does not support `/`


## ‚òëÔ∏è TODO list
- [ ] Support for capture flags in directories (`source/dir_*/path/*.png`)
- [ ] Support for  including `/` in captures with special capture flag: `**` (`source/**/path/**.png`)
- [ ] Support for moving/renaming directories (`source/directory/path/to/move`)
- [ ] Support for insertion flags in directories (`destination/dir_#1/path/#2.png`)
